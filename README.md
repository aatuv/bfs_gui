# Breadth-First Search Graphical User Interface
A program for interactively visualizing the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The user can draw obstacles and a destination node to a canvas grid.

### The algorithm
### TODO:
- Implement the basic BFS algorithm
- Figure out the best way how the algorithm could work with the resulting matrix from the user's drawing

### The UI
#### TODO:
- Add function for resetting drawing of obstacles
- Add function for adding a target node
- Add function for starting the BFS algorithm
